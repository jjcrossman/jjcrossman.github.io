<h2>A videogame backlog manager</h2>

This is a SPA for tracking your videogame backlog. It is bad, and only fully functions if you bypass your browser's security features.

All your added games will be forgotten when you close the browser tab, this app has no memory.

<h3>Things required for this app to function correctly:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Chrome Extension: Allow-Control-Allow-Origin.</strong> Disable or uninstall this extension before visiting any other website! It can interfere with other website's functionality or leave your computer vulnerable to security risks.</li>

<li><strong>An API key from Giant Bomb.</strong> Create a free account and request an API key. Insert that key in to Line 5 of js/routes/services/visualizerService.js</li>

<li>While on the Visualizer view, a <strong>shield icon may appear on the right edge of the address bar</strong>, click this and choose to allow unsafe scripts for this app.</li>
</ul>
